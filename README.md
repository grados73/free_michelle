# Aquarium controller
>The project, with the working name "free_miechelle", is a response to the lack of market proposals for aquarium control and management devices.


>>Now this project is being developed in another repository. -> https://github.com/grados73/akwa_elektron

## General info
Aquarium hobby has been one of my hobbies for over 10 years, along with cars, sports and electronics. I am a bit of a gadgeteer and like to have everything possible in a smart version, with easy management and monitoring. The same goes for aquariums, I would like to enjoy all the benefits that come with this hobby. Yes, I am a bit lazy. I would like to put in as little effort as possible, while being sure that my fish are well taken care of, even when I am away from home.  But there are no satisfactory solutions on the market to buy and use. All the devices that already exist have either limited capabilities or a technological debt that is heavily visible. Therefore, I decided to make such a device myself. I am currently at the stage of the first prototype, which I assemble using prototype boards. 

## Screenshots
Currently, the device is in a prototype version. It has been assembled on two prototype boards. The next version will have a dedicated PCB.

Currently, the software allows you to control the device and communicate with it through a 2.4" TFT screen, controlled by SPI. All commands are issued via the touch screen available on each of the 8 menu screens.
