## General info
Aquarium hobby has been one of my hobbies for over 10 years, along with cars, sports and electronics. I am a bit of a gadgeteer and like to have everything possible in a smart version, with easy management and monitoring. The same goes for aquariums, I would like to enjoy all the benefits that come with this hobby. Yes, I am a bit lazy. I would like to put in as little effort as possible, while being sure that my fish are well taken care of, even when I am away from home.  But there are no satisfactory solutions on the market to buy and use. All the devices that already exist have either limited capabilities or a technological debt that is heavily visible. Therefore, I decided to make such a device myself. I am currently at the stage of the first prototype, which I assemble using prototype boards.
